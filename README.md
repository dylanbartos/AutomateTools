# Automate Tools

This repository is a collection of PowerShell modules and tools to be used in conjunction with ConnectWise Automate. One of the basic features of the modules is to provide a flexible way to transfer data from the endpoint to the Automate system. There will be other tools included here that can be used as tools for technicians.

## Motivation

I wanted to build some PowerShell modules and tools that could be used flexibly in the Automate system as well as used locally by technicians. One of the features of these tools would be to have a quick way to adjust how data was being exported locally. Sometimes, in the Automate system you must save the data locally and read it back in to get multiple results.
